      <p class="text-off-white text-justify fs-18">
        Let’s take the Whatsapp last seen feature, for example. Unless you
        deliberately turn this feature off, every one of your contacts can see
        exactly when you were last online and whether or not their messages have
        reached you. If you’re trying to avoid someone or would prefer not to
        chat to them right now, this is less than ideal – and likewise, if one
        of your contacts switches off their Whatsapp last seen, you simply can’t
        tell whether or not they’ve seen your texts. We’ve all been there, and
        it’s admittedly pretty frustrating sometimes, especially when it’s
        obvious that their last seen on Whatsapp is wrong.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-white text-capitalize pt-2">
        How the Timestamp System Works
      </h2>
      <p class="text-off-white text-justify fs-18 pt-2">
        But what exactly is last seen, and how do you know how to turn off
        Whatsapp last seen on your own profile? Well, Whatsapp has a built-in
        timestamp that tells you whether a specific user is online or when they
        were ‘last seen’ at a particular time. For those users who want a bit
        more privacy on the app, they can choose to hide online Whatsapp android
        status from their other contacts, which removes this timestamp
        altogether.
      </p>
      <p class="text-off-white text-justify fs-18 pt-2">
        Currently, there are three settings available to achieve this, allowing
        you to show this information to all Whatsapp users, only your contacts,
        or nobody at all. Of course, while your last seen information might be
        hidden, people will always be able to see when you are actively online.
      </p>
      <p class="text-off-white text-justify fs-18 pt-2">
        If you want to know how to hide Whatsapp last seen time on your profile,
        you will need to choose the setting that bars everyone from viewing that
        info. If one of your contacts’ Whatsapp last seen today is not working,
        then you can be fairly certain that they have also turned off their
        friends’ ability to view their timestamps.
      </p>

      <p class="text-off-white text-justify fs-18 pt-2">
        Like with most privacy settings, the Whatsapp last seen feature can be
        both a blessing and a curse. As an example, let’s say that you are
        suspecting that your significant other isn’t being as faithful as they
        say they are. They’re always on their phone when they think you aren’t
        looking, sending texts under the duvet cover and spending just a little
        too much time in the bathroom with their smartphone in hand. If they
        have figured out how to turn off Whatsapp last seen, you won’t be able
        to see how frequently they’ve been online to confirm your suspicions.
        Well, not without our Chatwatch app, that is!
      </p>
      <p class="text-off-white text-justify fs-18 pt-3">
        Chatwatch is our cutting-edge Whatsapp tracking app that allows you to
        monitor your friends’, family members’, significant others’ or even
        employees’ chatting habits and usage. Even if they have found out how to
        hide last seen in Whatsapp Android or iOS, you can use our app to obtain
        comprehensive timelines that show you exactly when they were online,
        when they logged off, and how much time they spent chatting in between.
      </p>
      <p class="text-off-white text-justify fs-18 pt-2">
        There are many scenarios in which knowing who is online on Whatsapp
        might come in handy. Did you send your date a message a few days ago and
        haven’t heard back yet? Do you want to know if you’re being ghosted so
        that you can move on and explore greener pastures? Are you suspecting
        your significant other of chatting with someone else when they take
        suspicious trips to the bathroom at 3am? Are you worried about a BFF
        that you haven’t heard back from in a while? No matter why you need to
        get notification when someone is online on Whatsapp, we’re here to help
        you out.
      </p>
      <p class="text-off-white text-justify fs-18 pt-3">
        If you suspect foul play, Chatwatch will also use the power of
        artificial intelligence to show you when your contact went to bed, how
        many contacts they spoke to within a given time frame, and much, much
        more. It can also confirm by default whether or not they have opted to
        Whatsapp disable online status. They might be able to hide online
        Whatsapp Android timestamps, but with Chatwatch, you will always be one
        step ahead...
