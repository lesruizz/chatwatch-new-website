        MXit itself might seem woefully outdated today compared to modern apps
        like Whatsapp, but the fact remains that it was always beneficial to be
        able to see who was online and when. It was far easier to know if
        someone was avoiding your messages or sneaking around without your
        knowledge with that feature intact. On the other hand, how to check
        someone’s last seen on Whatsapp has always been a little more tricky…
        until now, that is.
      </p>
      <p class="text-off-white text-justify fs-18 pt-2">
        If you’ve been missing that invaluable ability to see who’s online and
        when they’ve logged off, don’t despair – we have the answer for you! We
        at Chatwatch are proud to bring you our Whatsapp online status checker
        app; a premium AI-based application that shows you exactly how to see
        who is online on Whatsapp – and how to check someone’s last seen on
        Whatsapp, too. Never again will you have to be left in the dark when it
        comes to which of your friends, family members or colleagues are online;
        our app does everything for you, giving you all the intel you need
        without having to splash out on pricey Private Eye services.

        How Our Whatsapp Online Checker Works
      </h2>
      <p class="text-off-white text-justify fs-18 pt-2">
        The curious minds out there may be wondering exactly how we show
        Chatwatch users when someone is online on Whatsapp. Our app is based on
        advanced artificial intelligence that gathers data on your contacts’
        usage habits and uses unique algorithms to make predictions about their
        activities. Simply put, if you want to know how to check who is online
        on Whatsapp, or simply discover how to find online friends in Whatsapp,
        Chatwatch will assess this information and send it back to you in a
        convenient and easy-to-read format.
      </p>
      <p class="text-off-white text-justify fs-18 pt-2">
        Of course, our app’s capabilities aren’t limited to simply showing you
        when your contacts are online. We can also show you exactly how much
        time they spend chatting on Whatsapp, how often they log on, and
        pecisely when they were last online. All you need to access these
        ground-breaking services is a computer and a Whatsapp account – as well
        as the certainty that you really do want to know what your contacts are
        up to! If you are absolutely certain that you do, it’s definitely time
        to take the leap…

        your significant other of chatting with someone else when they take
        suspicious trips to the bathroom at 3am? Are you worried about a BFF
        that you haven’t heard back from in a while? No matter why you need to
